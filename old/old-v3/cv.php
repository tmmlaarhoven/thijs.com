			<p>In 2011 I graduated cum laude in Industrial and Applied Mathematics from the Eindhoven 
			University of Technology, in the area of Coding Theory and Cryptology. In my final project 
			I helped Irdeto develop a new and more efficient algorithm for fingerprinting digital content, 
			which already lead to a patent and two peer-reviewed journal papers in less than one year.</p> 

			<p>Currently I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Eindhoven University of Technology, investigating 
			lattice-based cryptography and lattice basis reduction algorithms.</p>

			<h4>(2011 - present)</h4>
			<h2>PhD Candidate</h2>
			<h3>Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands</h3>

			<p>Lattice-based cryptosystems are cryptosystems based on hard problems in lattices, such as 
			finding the shortest vector in a lattice. Using lattice basis reduction, together with brute-
			force solvers for the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), one can sometimes solve these hard 
			problems and attack these cryptosystems. To estimate the security of these cryptosystems, it 
			is therefore essential to get a better understanding of lattice basis reduction algorithms, 
			such as LLL and BKZ, and techniques for	solving SVP, such as enumeration and sieving. In my 
			research I aim to get a better understanding of and find improvements for these algorithms.</p>

			<h4>(2010 - 2011)</h4>
			<h2>Intern</h2>
			<h3>Irdeto, Eindhoven, The Netherlands</h3>

			<p>During my internship at Irdeto I investigated traitor tracing schemes that are resistant 
			against so-called collusion-attacks. These schemes are used for watermarking digital content, 
			such as pay-tv. Focus was mostly on the Tardos scheme, but also on certain dynamic traitor 
			tracing schemes, and on the new invention we did, the dynamic Tardos scheme. This is also my 
			final project for my Master of Science degree at the TU/e.</p>

			<h4>(2009 - 2011)</h4>
			<h2>Master of Science in Mathematics (cum laude)</h2>
			<h3>Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands</h3>

			<p>I graduated in the group Coding Theory and Cryptology, which 
			is part of the section Discrete Mathematics. In the second year 
			I chose to do a final project combined with an internship which 
			I did with the company Irdeto. This internship concluded with 
			writing a Masters thesis, titled "Collusion-resistant traitor 
			tracing schemes", for which I was awarded a perfect 10/10.</p>

			<h4>(2006 - 2009)</h4>
			<h2>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics</h2>
			<h3>Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands</h3>

			<p>During these three years of my studies I also took many 
			courses in computer science. In the first year I obtained 
			propaedeutic diplomas for both mathematics and computer science, 
			and later I also followed a so-called "minor" in advanced 
			computer science, consisting of several courses in computer 
			science.</p>
					
			<p>The last part of these three years was focused on discrete 
			mathematics, which concluded with a final project and thesis 
			about the Collatz conjecture.</p>
