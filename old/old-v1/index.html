<h2>Homepage</h2>

Welcome to my website. Here I will try to put useful stuff related to what I do and what others may want to know about me or my work.
For questions or comments, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. <br/><br/>

Some of my research interests are below. You can also take a look at the publications I (co-)authored to get an impression of the
topics I'm interested in, or at least managed to get publishable results in.

<h3>Security of lattice-based cryptosystems</h3>

Soon...

<h3>Collusion-resistant traitor tracing</h3>

By embedding watermarks in digital content, distributors can try to catch pirates who distribute copyrighted content among non-paying 
users. Once a pirate puts his watermarked copy online, the distributor can intercept this copy, see what the hidden watermark is, to 
which user it belongs, and take steps against this user. However, pirates are smart, and they may consider buying several watermarked 
copies of the content, and comparing those to find parts of the watermark. If their content is the same, the only differences in the 
data are differences in the watermarks. So they could create a new copy, which matches their copies on those positions where they do
not detect any differences, and which could be anything on positions where they do detect differences in their copies. <br/><br/>

The research on collusion-resistant traitor tracing is about generating watermarks for all users in such a way that even if multiple
pirates collude, one can still catch (part of) the coalition with some tracing algorithm. In most common models of this problem 
several solutions are known, but in most cases no absolute optimal solution has been found yet. So there is still room for 
improvements in many areas.

<h3>The Collatz conjecture</h3>

A famous open problem in mathematics, or more specifically number theory, is the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz conjecture</a>. Starting with any positive integer n, the Collatz 
function is defined as f(n) = n/2 if n is even, and f(n) = 3n+1 if n is odd. The Collatz conjecture states that, starting from any
positive integer n, if we iterate this function long enough, we will always encounter 1 at some point. <br/><br/>

Even though this problem can be stated in such simple terms and was posed in 1937 already, it is still an open problem. Researchers
from many different areas of mathematics have tried investigating or solving this problem, with no success so far. By brute force
calculations the conjecture has been verified for all starting values up to 10<sup>18</sup>, but of course this can never lead to a
proof. The famous mathematician Paul Erdös once said that mathematics is not yet ready for such problems, and so far he is right.
